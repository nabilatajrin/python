#Problem Solution
1. Take the number of elements to be stored in the list as input.
2. Use a for loop to input elements into the list.
3. Calculate the total sum of elements in the list.
4. Divide the sum by total number of elements in the list.
5. Exit.


# Program/Source Code
n=int(input("Enter the number of elements to be inserted: "))
a=[]
for i in range(0,n):
    elem=int(input("Enter element: "))
    a.append(elem)
avg=sum(a)/n
print("Average of elements in the list",round(avg,2))


#Runtime Test Cases
 
Case 1:
Enter the number of elements to be inserted: 3
Enter element: 23
Enter element: 45
Enter element: 56
Average of elements in the list 41.33
 
Case 2:
Enter the number of elements to be inserted: 5
Enter element: 12
Enter element: 24
Enter element: 33
Enter element: 25
Enter element: 18
Average of elements in the list 22.4
